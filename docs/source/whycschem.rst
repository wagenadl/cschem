Position statement: Why use CSchem?
===================================

There are any number of software packages and online options available
that allow you to draw circuit diagrams. So why should you choose
CSchem?

Is CSchem for you?
------------------

CSchem is for you if:

- You like your circuit diagrams to look ready for publication
  straight from design;
- You like concentrating on the principles of your circuit while
  drawing the design (and leave the specific choices of components
  until the next day);
- You like to have quick access to the most commonly used
  symbols;
- You either don't need more uncommon symbols or are willing
  to draw them in an SVG editor;
- You like the companion program CPCB for laying out PCBs.

On the other hand, CSchem may not be for you if:

- You need to draw very large circuits that span multiple
  sheets;
- You need to specify lots of parameters with your components
  for an automated layout workflow. (CSchem will allow you to
  specify component values or part numbers, but does not have
  specific fields for vendors, packaging information, etc.)
- You need to have access to a large library of predrawn components.
- You need a help desk on call.

A note on development
---------------------

CSchem is being developed by an active research
scientist. Practically, that means two things: On the positive side,
it means that I have a vested interest in fixing bugs and improving
CSchem, because I use it regularly. On the negative side, it means
that, by and large, new features are added only when my students and I
need them and bugs are fixed when I have time. I certainly do welcome
feature requests, but I cannot guarantee that they will get
implemented quickly or at all. (If you are in a hurry, I will consider
(paid) consultancy related to CSchem.) Finally, I definitely welcome
contributions to either the code or the documentation. I would be very
happy if CSchem turned into a community-supported open source project.

Contacting the author
---------------------

If you like CSchem or find fault with it, if you discover a bug or
have a suggestion for a new feature, if you are interested in
improving this documentation or have a patch to contribute to the
code, I want to hear from you. My contact information is at
http://www.danielwagenaar.net. I very much look forward to hearing
from you, and I really do welcome questions, particularly if they help
me to improve CSchem or its documentation.
