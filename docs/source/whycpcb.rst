Position statement: Why use CPCB?
===================================

There are any number of software packages and online options available
that allow you to design PCBs. So why should you choose CPCB? CPCB is
for you if:

- You like a program that keeps simple tasks simple;
- You just want to make a few boards for a project and get on
  with your life;
- You like a what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach;
- You like to switch between imperial and metric units fluidly;
- You use CSchem for drawing circuits.        

On the other hand, CPCB might not be for you if:

- You need to specify arcane properties on
  your electronic parts for automated workflows;
- Your projects are so complex that you really need an
  autorouter;
- You need boards with internal layers.

A note on development
---------------------

CPCB is being developed by an active research scientist. Practically,
that means two things: On the positive side, it means that I have a
vested interest in fixing bugs and improving CPCB, because I use it
regularly. On the negative side, it means that, by and large, new
features are added only when my students and I need them, and bugs are
fixed when I have time. I certainly do welcome feature requests, but I
cannot guarantee that they will get implemented quickly or at all. (If
you are in a hurry, I will consider (paid) consultancy related to
CPCB.) Finally, I definitely welcome contributions to either the code
or the documentation. I would be very happy if CPCB turned into a
community-supported open source project.

Contacting the author
---------------------

If you like CPCB or find fault with it, if you discover a bug or have a
suggestion for a new feature, if you are interested in improving this
documentation or have a patch to contribute to the code, I want to
hear from you. My contact information is at
http://www.danielwagenaar.net. I very much look forward to hearing
from you, and I
really do welcome questions, particularly if they help me to improve
CPCB or its documentation.
