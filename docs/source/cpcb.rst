User guide: Realizing circuits on printed circuit boards using CPCB
===================================================================

This document describes the installation and usage of “CPCB,” a
(hopefully) easy-to-use program for designing printed circuit board
(PCBs) written by Daniel Wagenaar. A companion program, “CSchem,” is
provided for designing circuits prior to instantiating them on a
PCB. This program is documented in a :ref:`separate user guide <cschem>`.
