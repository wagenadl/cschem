It will create dotted lines as children to visually indicate snapping. \nWhat I do not know is whether I want to make positioning of annotations with subgrid precision possible. Probably, yes, if I am going to do snapping at all, because otherwise text to text alignment will never be precise, since the centers would be aligned to the grid.",
