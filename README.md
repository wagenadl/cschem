![CSchem and CPCB - Electronic circuit design and PCB layout](https://github.com/wagenadl/cschem/blob/main/docs/source/banner.svg)

## Introduction

CSchem and CPCB are a pair of programs for electronic circuit design and
PCB layout. Key features include:

* CSchem makes it easy to draw publication-quality designs.

* CSchem allows you to focus squarely on design principles and worry
  about implementation details later.

* CSchem can export designs as SVG files for direct import into
  Inkscape, Corel Draw, etc.

* CPCB allows linking a schematic to a PCB layout and offers
  highlighting of incomplete or wrongly connected nets.

* CPCB can export layouts as Gerber files for direct upload to
  fabricators such as JLCPCB and many others.

* Both programs have simple and intuitive user interfaces with fast
  learning curves for nonexperts.

CSchem and CPCB are free and open source and can be compiled on Windows, Mac, and
Linux.
