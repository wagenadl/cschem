    <!-- Symbols may be matched loosely. That is, a symbol named
         "part:diode:zener" would match a default rule with symbol
         "diode", but "zener" would be a better match, and
         "diode:zener" even better.

         A practical algorithm is that a rule "A:B:C" can match a
         symbol "X:Y:A:B:C:Z" but not "A:B:Y:C". Score is 2^k for a
         match at the k-th level. So "resistor" matches
         "part:passive:resistor" with a score of 2^2 and
         "capacitor:polarized" matches
         "part:passive:capacitor:polarized" with a score of
         2^2+2^3. Rule "diode:LED" matches "part:diode:LED" with a
         score of 2^1+2^2, outscoring rule "diode", which only scores
         2^1, and rule "LED", which scores 2^2.

         Container symbols like "part:container:X" automatically match
         to package "X".

         Ideally, rules should be checked for matching pin counts, but
         that is complicated by containers that are represented in the
         circuit by multiple symbols (e.g., two
         "part:ic:virtual:opamp" and one
         "part:container:opamp2"). Perhaps this is not a real
         argument, since containers generally work without an explicit
         <rule>. Another complication is that maps are not contained
         in this file if they are simple, e.g., for the dip8
         <package>. That means that cschem does not know how many pins
         a dip8 has without looking at the pcb files.
