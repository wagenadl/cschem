cschem 0.1.6

  Features:

  - Now builds on Windows and Mac. Windows "iss" script naive about versions:
    hardcoded.
  - In cpcb PickupTrace mode, can now move existing points with Shift
  - In cpcb PlaceTrace mode, can now move existing points with Shift
  - Added several symbols and outlines
  - Improved styling of selected/deselected tools
  - Now uses ".cschem" as file extension for cschem
  - New python script test/circalyse.py to help analyze circuits in cschem
  - Better net mismatch testing in cpcb: now tests for duplicated part refs
    and duplicated pin names within named parts
  - Some trivial GUI improvements

  Bugfixes:

  - Hole with FP connection now correctly calculates touches with Trace. This
    required making the "default dimension" functions in Board static. This
    is not ideal, but acceptable for now.
  - MainWindow now uses getOpenFileName correctly.
